\chapter{Future Developments}

We have lot of exciting plans for future model improvements, some of which
are in a already mature stage and under testing, with some published results,
whereas others are done only on the paper in a whishlist for next years.
Nevertheless we want to share this with users, to have hints and encourage
contributions.
Some of the development results/ideas are listed below, in a "time to market"
order.

\section{Tiedtke convection scheme}

Adrian Tompkins is developing an adaptation of the ECMWF 38R2 \cite{Tiedtke_89}
cumulus convection scheme for the \ac{RegCM} model.

\section{Semi-Lagrangian dynamic core}

A semi-Lagrangian advection scheme for the water vapor and advection tracers
will allow a different timestep for the transport schemes, which should result
in a performance prize.

\section{Non-Hydrostatic core}

We want to implement the non-hydrostatic core to allow physical downscaling
of large scale model simulation under the 20 kilometers limit of the
hydrostatic model.
