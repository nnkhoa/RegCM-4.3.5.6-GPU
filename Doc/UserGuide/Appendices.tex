We will review here a sample installation session of software needed to
install the RegCM model.

The starting point is here a Linux system on a multicore processor box, and
the final goal is to have an optimized system to run the model.
I will use \verb=bash= as my shell and assume that GNU development tools like
\verb=make=, \verb=sed=, \verb=awk= are installed as part of the default
Operating System environment as is the case in most Linux distro.
I will require also for commodity a command line web downloader such as
\verb=curl= installed on the system, along its development libraries to be
used to enable OpenDAP remote data access protocol capabilities of netCDF
library. Standard file management tools such as \verb=tar= and \verb=gzip=
and \verb=wget= are also required.
The symbol \verb=$>= will stand for a shell prompt.
I will assume that the process is performed as a normal system user, which
will own all the toolchain. I will be now just the \verb=regcm= user.

\section{Identify Processor}

First step is to identify the processor to know its capabilities:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> cat /proc/cpuinfo
\end{Verbatim}

This command will ask to the operating system to print processor informations.
A sample answer on my laptop is:

\begin{Verbatim}
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 30
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU       Q 740  @ 1.73GHz
stepping        : 5
cpu MHz         : 933.000
cache size      : 6144 KB
physical id     : 0
siblings        : 8
core id         : 0
cpu cores       : 4
apicid          : 0
initial apicid  : 0
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : yes
cpuid level     : 11
wp              : yes
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge

bogomips        : 3467.81                                                       
clflush size    : 64                                                            
cache_alignment : 64                                                            
address sizes   : 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual                             
power management:
\end{Verbatim}

repeated eight time with Processor Ids from 0 to 7: I have a Quad Core Intel
with Hyperthreading on (this multiply by 2 the reported processor list).
The processor reports here also to support Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions V4.2,
which can be later used to speed up code execution vectorizing floating point
operation on any single CPU core.

\section{Chose compiler}

Depending on the processor, we can chose which compiler to use. On a Linux box,
we have multiple choices:

\begin{itemize}
\item GNU Gfortran
\item G95
\item Intel ifort compiler
\item Portland compiler
\item Absoft ProFortran
\item NAG Fortran Compiler
\end{itemize}

and for sure other which I may not be aware of. All of these compilers have pros
and cons, so I am just for now selecting one in the pool only to continue the
exposition. I am not selecting the trivial solution of Gfortran as most
Linux distributions have it already packaged, and all the other required
software as well (most complete distribution I am aware of for this is Fedora:
all needed software is packaged and it is a matter of yum install).

So let us assume I have licensed the Intel Composer XE Professional Suite
13.0.0 on my laptop. My system administrator installed it on the default
location under \verb=/opt/intel=, and I have my shell environment update
loading vendor provided script:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
\end{Verbatim}

With some modification (the path, the script, the arguments to the script),
same step is to be performed for all non-GNU compilers in the above list, and
is documented in the installation manual of the compiler itself.

In case of Intel, to check the correct behaviour of the compiler, try to
type the following command:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> ifort --version
ifort (IFORT) 13.0.0 20120731
Copyright (C) 1985-2012 Intel Corporation.  All rights reserved.
\end{Verbatim}

I am skipping here any problem that may arise from license installation for any
of the compilers, so I am assuming that if the compiler is callable, it works.
As this step is usually performed by a system administrator on the machine,
I am assuming a skilled professional will take care of that.

\section{Environment setup}

To efficiently use the compilers, I will setup now some environment variables.
On my system (see the above processor informations) I will use:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> # Where all the software will be installed ?
$> # I am chosing here a place under my home directory.
$> export INTELROOT=/home/regcm/intelsoft
$> # the C compiler. I am assuming here to have the whole Intel
$> # Composer XE suite, so I will use the intel C compiler.
$> export CC=icc
$> # the C++ compiler, the intel one.
$> export CXX=icpc
$> # the Fortran 2003 compiler.
$> export FC=ifort
$> # the Foirtran 77 compiler. For intel, is just the fortran one.
$> export F77=ifort
$> # C Compiler flags
$> export CFLAGS="-O3 -xHost -axSSE4.2 -fPIC"
$> # FORTRAN Compiler flags
$> export FCFLAGS="-O3 -xHost -axSSE4.2 -fPIC"
$> # F77 Compiler flags
$> export FFLAGS="-O3 -xHost -axSSE4.2 -fPIC"
$> # CXX Compiler flags
$> export CXXFLAGS="-O3 -xHost -axSSE4.2 -fPIC"
$> # Linker flags
$> export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=$INTELROOT/lib \
> -Wl,-rpath=/opt/intel/lib/intel64 -i-dynamic"
$> # Preset PATH to use the installed software during build
$> export PATH=$INTELROOT/bin:$PATH
$> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$INTELROOT/lib
$> export MANPATH=$INTELROOT/share/man:$MANPATH
\end{Verbatim}

This step will allow me not to specify those variables at every following step.
Depending on the above compiler selected, those flags my differ for you, but the
concept is that I am selecting a performance target build for the machine I am
on. I am now ready to compile software.

\section{Pre requisite library installation}

To build a complete optimized stack, a sample script have been added
in \verb=Tools/Script/prereq_install.sh=
This help script will build netCDF V4 and MPICH2 libraries to be used to
compile the RegCM model.
Following the above settings, the script must be edited in the first lines
setting the \verb=DEST= variable to \verb=$INTELROOT=.

Then we can just execute the script:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> ./prereq_install.sh
This script installs the netCDF/mpi librares in the

         /home/regcm/intelsoft

directory. If something goes wrong, logs are saved in

         /home/regcm/intelsoft/logs

Downloading ZLIB library...
Downloading HDF5 library...
Downloading netCDF Library...
Downloading MPICH2 Library...

Compiling zlib Library.

Compiling netCDF Library.

Done!
To link RegCM with this librares use:

PATH=/home/regcm/intelsoft/bin:$PATH ./configure \
  CC=icc FC=ifort \
  CPPFLAGS=-I/home/regcm/intelsoft/include \
  LDFLAGS=-L/home/regcm/intelsoft/lib \
  LIBS="-lnetcdff -lnetcdf -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz"

\end{Verbatim}

The admins who must compile the pre requisite libraries are invited to look
at the script, identifying the various steps.
The normal user should be content of the last printout message which details
how to use the just built libraries to compile RegCM model sources against.
At run time an environment variable must be added to set correct paths:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> export PATH=/home/regcm/intelsoft/bin:$PATH
\end{Verbatim}
